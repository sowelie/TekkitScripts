This was forked from https://github.com/andersevenrud/TekkitScripts.  This is not my work! I created a fork and added code
to make the reactor more efficient.  I use the layout described here: http://thetekkit.wikia.com/wiki/Tutorial_/_Safe,_Easy,_&_Powerful_Nuclear_Reactor.

My tweaks attempt to make sure that the ice is always loaded in a way that it preserves the original layout of the
reactor.

Thank you to andersevenrud for the original script.

A collection of Lua scripts/APIs and schematics for creating advanced machines in Tekkit (Minecraft)

This was all created using Tekkit 3.1.2

# Scripts

## nuke-controller
Fully automatic Nuclear Reactor Power Plant, using ComputerCraft control system.

Handles monitoring, fueling and cooling of one or more nuclear reactors.

### Schematics

See `nuke-schema.png`

**NOTE:** This is only compatible with IC2 version 1.103, but a reconfiguration would make it compatible with latest revisions (There has been some changes to the cooling procedures).

### Console Usage

Run `nuke-controller [(-debugOn true|false), (-dryRun true|false)]`

Copy `nuke-controller.startup` to `/disk/startup` to automatically start (and update to latest version) on boot/server-restart (assuming HTTP is enabled)

### Instructions

* First check out the comments in the top of the source-file
* Build according to schematics and correctly configure parameters and peripherals
* Place a ccSensor with an IC2 Module Card near the core(s)
* Set up your computer rig with a ccSensor Controller
* Start the Application (described above)
* Click the connected button (ONCE) to start up reactors and initialize systems
- The core should now be running
* Click the connected button (ONCE -- again) to perform the shutdown procedure

The alarm will sound when first powering up the reactor and when the thermostat is triggered.

Default configuration is set to 10 Cooling-cells, 44 Fuel-cells and a maximum core-temp at 2000 degrees.
This outputs ~1800 EU per reactor.

**NOTE:** Current version requires you to insert a fuel-cell into reactor(s) after launching application.

**NOTE:** You may have to tweak the settings depending on environment (default config is for SMP, others documented in source)

## nuke-stats
Display stats from `nuke-controller`

### Console Usage

Run `nuke-stats` (Remember to check configuration parameters in the top section of script)

Copy `nuke-stats.startup` to `/disk/startup` to automatically start (and update to latest version) on boot/server-restart (assuming HTTP is enabled)

## dl-script
Download a file from pastebin.com and save it on the console or disk.

### Console Usage

Run `dl-script <url> <absolute-destination-path>`, launch without arguments to see more
